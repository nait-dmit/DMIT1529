# [Lab] Rewalk – Checkpoint 1

From the lecture notes provided, complete the following steps:

  1. Trace the Design Comp Structure – you may work in Illustrator, Photoshop, Keynote, or on paper. Your task is to trace out the structure of the design comp, reducing the complexity of the original design comp to give us a simple wireframe to start building off. Export your final traced image (showing only the structural elements) as a .png or .jpg.
  * Set up a Project Folder – since we'll be using as many assets as necessary to build our page, we'll likely need a full project folder. Create that folder structure, along with an index.html and a style.css file.

## Submission Requirements

In order to submit this lab, you must complete all of the following:

  1. Upload a .jpg or .png image of your wireframe to Moodle.
  * Upload your zipped project folder to Moodle.
